This directory contains:

- L1: a shell script that runs an L1 interpreter. Pass it the name of
      a file containing an L1 program and get back the results.

      The script requires that you have PLT Scheme v4.2.5 installed
      and its bin directory on your path. If that is not the case,
      then (once PLT v4.2.5 is installed), edit the script to point to
      mzscheme in the bin directory. 

- run.ss: a file that allows you to run the interpreter via
          DrScheme. Start up DrScheme, open the file, and call
          L1-inter/file with whatever file you want to run in the
          interpreter.

          Note that the command-line version has more options than
          this does.

- fib.L1: the first fib example from the lecture notes

- compiled/: a directory containing bytecode that implements the
             interpreter.

- README: this file
